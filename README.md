## Project : [Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-related Tweets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19lLNqWjHh4yOlqixauOW2SEq-6HXlLgY/view?usp=sharing)
In unprecedented times such as right now with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that
governments make the correct policies in the best interest of their countries’ people. It has
been said that with worsening global warming and overpopulation, it is possible that
pandemics will make frequent reappearances in the future (Rall, 2021). As such, it is
important to equip governments with the knowledge of past pandemics, such as the public
sentiments and responses towards their policies, in order to be better prepared for any
similar situations in the future.

Thus, our group has decided to build a public sentiment analyser that analyses both past
and real-time COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from Twitter, one of the most widely-used
social media platforms worldwide. Through this sentiment analysis, we aim to provide the
Singapore government with useful topic-specific insights about the public sentiments with
relation to significant global events to assist them in making well-informed decisions in future
pandemics.

The reason behind using tweets collected globally rather than limiting to a particular location
is because we believe that analysing global sentiments regarding vaccines against global
events is more relevant to Singapore’s government policies as opposed to using analysis
limited to a particular region or country. First of all, most government policies follow after
global events. One example is how after the FDA granted authorization for vaccination of
children under 12, the Singapore government quickly pushed out vaccination drives for
children. Secondly, in Singapore, where a large percentage of the population own a
smartphone, there is a strong correlation between local sentiments and global sentiments.
Thus, we believe that the analysis of global sentiments against such global events would be
helpful for the Singapore government in implementing policies in future pandemics.

If the Singapore government is able to obtain these insights on public sentiments, it will allow
them to forecast the vaccination levels in the case of another pandemic and evaluate the
efficacy of their vaccination policies and regulations, and allow them to be better prepared
for future pandemics and react quickly and appropriately.
